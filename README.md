# European Country Guesser

Hi I have created an app which can guess any European country you think of, just by asking a few yes or no questions.  At any point throughout the app, if you are not sure of the answer to the question, just search up the answer on google or another search engine. Thanks and hope you like the app

A few things to note - I have combined Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, and just called it Ireland, in my app. This means that Ireland is an island.

Also the flags of Denmark, Sweden, Iceland, Norway and Finland, contain a background with a cross, no vertical or horizontal stripes.

For Example - Denmark has a red background with a white cross.
